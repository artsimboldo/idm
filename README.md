### Controls
- Use arrow keys to control the user-driven agent (Doctor Moreau)

### Agents behaviours (by order of complexity):
- Rabbits: these are preys, just moving randomly in the map. 
- Man-dog: simple behaviour, roaming and going to the village to find his food.
- Hyena-pig: same as Man-dog.
- Leopard-man: more complex behaviours roaming, chasing preys, and spying Moreau. 
- Doctor Moreau: interactive agent, use up/down/left/right arrows for moving.

### Instructions
Install http://jason.sourceforge.net. Tested with Jason 1.3.3.  
Jason installer includes jEdit, an IDE supporitng both Java and AgentSpeak idioms.   
Open `iDM\src\iDM.mas2j` in jEdit and hit the run command.

### Simulation parameters
In jEdit, the iDM.mas2j project file contains editable parameters that can be modified:  
- Map (a GIF file that can be edited)
- Number of preys (rabbits)
- Preys re-generation 
- Simulation step (ms)
- Agents to simulate
- visuals: window size, animation, grid and agents infos
